<h1>Welcome</h1>


<h3>Personal note</h3>
<p> Thrilled you're here :).<br>
  My first professional objective is landing a job in a field I find intersting and the task at hand is mainly around gathering insights by harnessing data.<br>
  I guess my CV got you here so I'll keep it lite... Come with an open mind, how many CPAs do you know with a github page?<br>
  Hopefully you'd like to know eachother following the work you'll see below(which will be udpdated on a weekly basis going forward).<br>
  Oh, and if you didn't like it, be sure to leave a <strong>feedback</strong> and lmk what was missing for you. This will be greatly <strong>appreciated</strong>.</p>
  
  
  <p>Let's dive in!</p>
