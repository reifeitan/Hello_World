<h3>Intro</h3>
<p> 
  My first professional objective is landing a job in a field I find interesting and the task at hand is mainly around gathering insights by harnessing data.<br>
  <br>
I like solving problems. Google, Medium\stackoverflow are probably my most close professional friends.
And the most important thing is that I enjoy building useful stuff, with a strong business orientation.<br>
Also,  I believe my background as a CPA gives me a deeper understanding and unique perspective to explore data in a more businessy way, on top of the soft skills I gained over the years participating in hundred of meetings with units' leaders.<br>
<br>
  Creative problem solving? definitely me. How many CPAs do you know with a github page? ;)<br>
  <br>
  Feel free to leave <strong>feedback</strong> and lmk what could be done better. This will be greatly <strong>appreciated</strong>.<br>
  The work below will be updated on a weekly basis going forward.<br>
  
</p>
  
  
  <p>Let's dive in!</p>
