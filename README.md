<h3>Intro</h3>
<p> 
  My first professional objective is landing a job in a field I find interesting and the task at hand is mainly around gathering insights by harnessing data.<br>
  An analytical person is more than being comfortable around numbers. It's about understanding different processes from different disciplines in a timely manner,   which in return will generate great analysis with beneficial insights.
  My previous roles were very diverse cause I had to work different teams 
  how many CPAs do you know with a github page? ;)<br>
  Feel free to leave <strong>feedback</strong> and lmk what could be done better. This will be greatly <strong>appreciated</strong>.
  The work below will be updated on a weekly basis going forward.<br>
  
</p>
  
  
  <p>Let's dive in!</p>

 I will explore it to gather some insights about the genres, actors, directors and more.<br>
 * The dataset has null values and I'll fill them using numpy/pandas and LR prediction using scikit<br>
